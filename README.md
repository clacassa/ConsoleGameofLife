# ConsoleGameofLife
This program runs the John Conway's game of life in your console.
This is done by managing the input/output and the cursor position.

# Build/Setup
Download the repository and put its content in a folder named "ConsoleGameofLife"
or something similar, then run "make" from this location. The executable, "cgol.exe",
is generated in the ./bin subfolder. You could consider adding this in your
PATH variable to run it from anywhere. Although this program
is not relly useful, I wanted it to share the spirit of the GNU binutils.
